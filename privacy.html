      <h3>Data Security</h3>
      <p>
        We prioritize data security by implementing robust measures, including
        industry-standard encryption for secure data transmission, restricted

        firewalls to safeguard against unauthorized access, and regular security
        audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities. While we
        strive to protect personal data to the best of our ability, it's
        important to note that no method of transmission or storage over the
        internet is entirely foolproof. We continually update and improve our
        security practices to safeguard user information.

        We will retain your personal data only for the duration necessary to
        fulfill the purposes outlined in our privacy policy, or as required by
        applicable laws and regulations. Once the retention period expires, your
        data will be securely deleted or anonymized to ensure it is no longer
        identifiable or accessible.
